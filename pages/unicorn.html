            What is a Unicorn?
        </h1>

        <p>
            The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed,
            spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.
            <br><br>
            In European literature and art, the unicorn has for the last thousand years or so been depicted as a white horse-like 
            or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with spiralling grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. 
            In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of 
            purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power 
            to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal 
            was sometimes sold as a unicorn horn.
            <br><br>
            A bovine type of unicorn is thought by some scholars to have been depicted in seals of the Bronze Age Indus Valley 
            Civilization, the interpretation remaining controversial. An equine form of the unicorn was mentioned by the ancient
            Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, Aelian and
            Cosmas Indicopleustes. The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some translations render as unicorn.
            <br><br>
            The unicorn continues to hold a place in popular culture. It is often used as a symbol of fantasy or rarity.
        </p>

    <h2>Indus Valley Civilization</h2>
        <p>
            A creature with a single horn, conventionally called a unicorn is the most common image on the soapstone stamp seals 
            of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization ("IVC"), from the centuries around 2000 BC. It has a body more like a cow 
            than a horse, and a curved horn that goes forward, then up at the tip. The mysterious feature depicted coming down from 
            the front of the back is usually shown; it may represent a harness or other covering. Typically the unicorn faces a
            vertical object with at least two stages; this is variously described as a "ritual offering stand", an incense burner,
            or a manger. The animal is always in profile on Indus seals, but the theory that it represents animals with two horns, 
            one hiding the other, is disproved by a (much smaller) number of small terracotta unicorns, probably toys, 
            and the profile depictions of bulls, where both horns are clearly shown. It is thought that the unicorn was the 
            symbol of a powerful "clan or merchant community", but may also have had some religious significance.
            <br><br>
            In South Asia the unicorn is only seen during the IVC period — it disappears in South Asian art ever since. 
            Jonathan Mark Kenoyer notes the IVC unicorn to not have any "direct connection" with later unicorn motifs observed 
            in other parts of world; nonetheless it remains possible that the IVC unicorn had contributed to later myths of 
            fantastical one-horned creatures in West Asia.
        </p>

        <h2>In antiquity</h2>
        <p>
            Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology, but rather in the accounts of natural history, for Greek writers of natural
            history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and fabulous realm 
            for them. The earliest description is from Ctesias, who in his book Indika ("On India") described them as wild asses, 
            fleet of foot, having a horn a cubit and a half (700 mm, 28 inches) in length, and colored white, red and black.
            <br><br>

            Unicorn in Apadana, Shush, Iran
            Ctesias got his information while living in Persia. Unicorns on a relief sculpture have been found at the ancient
            Persian capital of Persepolis in Iran. Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one-horned animals, 
            the oryx (a kind of antelope) and the so-called "Indian ass" (ἰνδικὸς ὄνος). Antigonus of Carystus also wrote 
            about the one-horned "Indian ass". Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one-horned horses with stag-like 
            heads. Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox (perhaps a Greater one-horned rhinoceros) as one-horned 
            beasts, as well as "a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag, the feet of the elephant,
            and the tail of the boar, while the rest of the body is like that of the horse; it makes a deep lowing noise, and 
            has a single black horn, which projects from the middle of its forehead, two cubits [900 mm, 35 inches] in length."
            In On the Nature of Animals (Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος, De natura animalium), Aelian, quoting Ctesias, adds that India 
            produces also a one-horned horse (iii. 41; iv. 52), and says (that the monoceros (Greek: μονόκερως) was sometimes
                called cartazonos (Greek: καρτάζωνος), which may be a form of the Arabic karkadann, meaning "rhinoceros".
                <br><br>
            Cosmas Indicopleustes, a merchant of Alexandria who lived in the 6th century, made a voyage to India and subsequently 
            wrote works on cosmography. He gives a description of a unicorn based on four brass figures in the palace of the 
            King of Ethiopia. He states, from report, that "it is impossible to take this ferocious beast alive; and that all its 
            strength lies in its horn. When it finds itself pursued and in danger of capture, it throws itself from a precipice, 
            and turns so aptly in falling, that it receives all the shock upon the horn, and so escapes safe and sound".
        </p>

        <h2>Middle Ages and Renaissance</h2>

        <p>
            Medieval knowledge of the fabulous beast stemmed from biblical and ancient sources, and the creature was variously 
            represented as a kind of wild ass, goat, or horse.
            <br><br>
            The predecessor of the medieval bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as Physiologus (Φυσιολόγος), 
            popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood 
            for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became 
            a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in both secular and 
            religious art. The unicorn is often shown hunted, raising parallels both with vulnerable virgins and sometimes the 
            Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some 
            writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.
            <br><br>
            The unicorn also figured in courtly terms: for some 13th-century French authors such as Thibaut of Champagne and 
            Richard de Fournival, the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of humanism, 
            the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays 
            this role in Petrarch's Triumph of Chastity, and on the reverse of Piero della Francesca's portrait of Battista Strozzi, 
            paired with that of her husband Federico da Montefeltro (painted c. 1472–74), Bianca's triumphal car is drawn by a pair 
            of unicorns.
            <br><br>
            However, when the unicorn appears in the medieval legend of Barlaam and Josaphat, ultimately derived from the 
            life of the Buddha, it represents death, as the Golden Legend explains. Unicorns in religious art largely 
            disappeared after they were condemned by Molanus after the Council of Trent.
            <br><br>

            The unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described 
            them as "scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. 
            They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's… 
            They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are 
            not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary 
            to our notions." It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros.

            The Throne Chair of Denmark is partly made of "unicorn horns" – in fact narwhal tusks. The same material was 
            used for ceremonial cups because the unicorn's horn continued to be believed to neutralize poison, following 
            classical authors.
        </p>

        <h2>Alicorn</h2>
        <p>
            The horn itself and the substance it was made of was called alicorn, and it was believed that the horn 
            holds magical and medicinal properties. The Danish physician Ole Worm determined in 1638 that the alleged 
            alicorns were the tusks of narwhals. Such beliefs were examined wittily and at length in 1646 by Sir 
            Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica.
            <br><br>
            False alicorn powder, made from the tusks of narwhals or horns of various animals, has been sold in 
            Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741. The alicorn was thought to cure many diseases and have 
            the ability to detect poisons, and many physicians would make "cures" and sell them. Cups were made from
            alicorn for kings and given as a gift; these were usually made of ivory or walrus ivory. Entire horns were 
            very precious in the Middle Ages and were often really the tusks of narwhals.
        </p>

        <h2>Entrapment</h2>
        <p>
            In one of his notebooks Leonardo da Vinci wrote:
            <br><br>
            The unicorn, through its intemperance and not knowing how to control itself, for the love 
            it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go 
            up to a seated damsel and go to sleep in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.
            <br><br>
            The famous late Gothic series of seven tapestry hangings The Hunt of the Unicorn are a high point 
            in European tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang 
            in the Cloisters division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the series, richly dressed 
            noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against mille-fleur backgrounds or settings of
            buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms,
            appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, "The Unicorn in Captivity"
            , the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a pomegranate tree surrounded by a fence, in a field
            of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from 
            pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected 
            unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the Low Countries, probably 
            Brussels or Liège, for an unknown patron. A set of six engravings on the same theme, treated rather 
            differently, were engraved by the French artist Jean Duvet in the 1540s.
            <br><br>
            Another famous set of six tapestries of Dame à la licorne ("Lady with the unicorn") in the Musée de Cluny, Paris, 
            were also woven in the Southern Netherlands before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) 
            and finally Love ("A mon seul desir" the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece. Facsimiles of these 
            unicorn tapestries were woven for permanent display in Stirling Castle, Scotland, to take the place of a set 
            recorded in the castle in a 16th-century inventory.
            <br><br>
            A rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the hortus conclusus in religious art combined the 
            Annunciation to Mary with the themes of the Hunt of the Unicorn and Virgin and Unicorn, so popular in secular 
            art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in 
            many prima facie secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such 
            ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into 
            the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The Council of 
            Trent finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction,[29] partly on the grounds of 
            realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal.
            <br><br>
            Shakespeare scholars describe unicorns being captured by a hunter standing in front of a tree, 
            the unicorn goaded into charging; the hunter would step aside the last moment and the unicorn would 
            embed its horn deeply into the tree (See annotations[30] of Timon of Athens, Act 4, scene 3, c. line 341: 
            "wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury".)
        </p>

        <h2>Heraldry</h2>
        <p>
            In heraldry, a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and 
            a slender, spiral horn on its forehead[31] (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones, as can
            be seen from the following gallery). Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome 
            animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 
            15th century.[31] Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has
            been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has 
            broken free from its bondage.
        </p>

        <h2>Scotland</h2>
        <p> 
            In heraldry the unicorn is best known as a symbol of Scotland: the unicorn was believed to be the natural enemy
            of the lion – a symbol that the English royals had adopted around a hundred years before[32] Two unicorns supported
            the royal arms of the King of Scots, and since the 1707 union of England and Scotland, the royal arms of the 
            United Kingdom have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: 
            that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left and giving it a 
            crown, whereas the version used in England and elsewhere gives the English elements more prominence.

            Golden coins known as the unicorn and half-unicorn, both with a unicorn on the obverse, were used in Scotland 
            in the 15th and 16th century. In the same realm, carved unicorns were often used as finials on the pillars of 
            Mercat crosses, and denoted that the settlement was a royal burgh. Certain noblemen such as the Earl of Kinnoull 
            were given special permission to use the unicorn in their arms, as an augmentation of honour. The crest for 
            Clan Cunningham bears a unicorn head.
